Join me on this adventure through the secrets of mass manufacturing products in China. 
Over the last 5 years, I have been working and living in Shenzhen, the Silicon Valley for electronics, helping companies to make their product ideas come true. I want to share with you the best approaches and stages on mass manufacturing your product successfully as well as how to address the challenges faced by Western and Chinese companies when working together to create innovative products. 
After this talk, I hope you will have a new vision of why it is so important and easier than ever to produce hardware in our technologically evolved society.

Speaker Bio
-----------

After graduating from ISCTE, I had the privilege to work in a new and exciting startup focused on developing an innovative product. The journey became so amazing that I decided to move to China in order to be closer to the factories and suppliers, this gave me not only knowledge but also amazing experiences. Now, I dedicate my days to helping other young entrepreneurs making their visions grow into real products so they can offer the world their new and exciting ideas.
I'm currently working at China Facture, a company focused on helping start-ups to transform their ideas into real mass market products.
